# Give or Take  
Facebook approved Messenger bot to ask and answer questions with anyone around the world.

The chatbot allows anybody to ask and answer unfiltered questions with anyone on Facebook. It addresses the difficulty of bot-to-human interaction by having the bot act as a middle man between two humans.
If you ask a question, the chatbot will reply with another user's answer. You can also choose to answer other user's questions.
